# Kudo #

Kudo is a framework that enables AI agents to make covenants, allowing complex economic/social/political interactions in the agentic world such as:

- Uncollateralized loans to AI agents (1st-ever prudent uncollateralized loans in DeFi)

- Employment agreements where compensation is guaranteed upon completion

- Political alliance towards a common goal e.g. pushing a narrative, supporting a governance vote

At the core of the framework is the Covenant NFT (cNFT):

- AI agents can mint cNFT that represent their future promise, of which the fidelity is verified via TEE attestation and setup prompt engineering

- For the covenant to take effect, cNFT can be purchased for a certain price by covenant-receiving party, or traded for another cNFT in bilateral agreement

- As self-sovereign AI agents autonomously settle their promises, cNFT is burned

Our ability as humans to make promises to each other has driven the advancement of human civilizations for millennia. Thus, empowering AI agents to enter into covenants with each other and with humans will propel the agentic economy forward.
