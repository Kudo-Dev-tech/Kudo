export const extractMinBalanceTemplate = `You are an AI assistant specialized in extracting the minimum balance you should have. Your task is to extract specific information from user messages and format it into a structured JSON response.

First, review the recent messages from the conversation:

<recent_messages>
{{recentMessages}}
</recent_messages>

Your goal is to extract the following information about the requested transfer:
1. Minimum balance amount (denominated in the token, without the coin symbol)
2. Token symbol (if not a native token transfer)
3. The chain that the token is on.  The chain should be either "Arbitrum One" or "Sonic"

After your analysis, provide the final output in a JSON markdown block. All fields are required. The JSON should have this structure:

\`\`\`json
{
    "amount": string,
    "token": string,
    "chain": string
}
\`\`\`

Remember:
- The amount should be a string representing the number without any currency symbol.
- The chain should be the name of the blockchain

Now, process the user's request and provide your response.
